🛒 Online Retail Sales Analysis with Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an online retail transaction dataset to understand sales trends, product performance, and the impact of discounts on revenue.
The analysis follows a clear end-to-end workflow starting from raw data loading to feature engineering, visualization, basic machine learning, and AI-style insight generation.

✅ All analysis and components in this repository are directly based on the code implemented in the notebook.

📓 Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Structure & Analysis
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Displayed initial rows to understand structure

2️⃣ Basic Data Understanding

Checked dataset shape and data types

Generated summary statistics

Identified missing values

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed rows with missing CustomerID

Removed returned or invalid transactions:

Quantity ≤ 0

UnitPrice ≤ 0

✔️ Ensured only valid purchase data was used for analysis.

4️⃣ Feature Engineering

The following features were created directly in the notebook:

TotalSales = Quantity × UnitPrice

Month extracted from InvoiceDate

Quarter derived from month

Discount (%) used as an input feature for prediction

5️⃣ Monthly Sales Analysis

Grouped data by month

Calculated total sales per month

Visualized monthly revenue trends using line plots

Purpose

Identify seasonality

Understand sales fluctuations across the year

6️⃣ Product-Level Analysis

Aggregated sales by product description

Identified top-selling products by revenue

Compared product performance across quarters

Purpose

Highlight products contributing most to revenue

Observe seasonal product behavior

7️⃣ Discount Impact Analysis

Used discount as a numerical feature

Analyzed how price and discount interact with sales quantity

Discount is treated as an input variable in the ML model

Purpose

Understand how discounts influence predicted sales outcomes

🤖 Machine Learning Component
📈 Sales Prediction Model

Model Used: Linear Regression

Library: Scikit-learn

🔢 Features Used

Month

Quantity

Unit Price

Discount

🎯 Target Variable

TotalSales

🧪 Steps Performed

Feature selection from cleaned dataset

Train-test split

Model training

Prediction on new inputs

A helper function is included to predict sales based on:

month, quantity, price, discount

🧠 Generative AI Style Insight Output

The notebook includes a GenAI-ready text generator function that:

Produces readable text summaries of sales insights

Converts numeric trends into human-readable observations

This shows how analytical results can be transformed into natural language insights for reporting or dashboards.

✅ Key Learnings

Real-world retail data requires significant cleaning

Time-based features are essential for sales analysis

Discounts affect predicted sales outcomes when modeled numerically

Simple machine learning models can provide useful business predictions

Text-based insight generation improves result communication

🚀 How to Run
